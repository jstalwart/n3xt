These documents are used to implement a predicting model about the probabilities of scoring a goal. 

I have created two programs to achive this. First, there is a Python file whose objective is to read the json files saved in the events folder and create an excel
file with the information required (goals and coordenates). 

The second program, written in R, generates a quadratic discriminating analysis that gets us the probabilities of scoring a goal. It has a graphic with the probabilities
and a simple algorithm that predicts the probability of scoring from the coordenates that we input. I have written this program in RMarkdown and I have printed in the html format. 
However I am not sure if you will be able to use the algorithm to predict the variables in a html format so i have added the Rmd too. 

I am sorry, I have written the explanations in Spanish because I hoped to translate it later. However I have found myself in a situation in which i had no time, so 
I have decided to let it be.

Edit: I have uploaded the version in English.
